# Changelog

All notable changes to `@uehaj/sys1grep` (`@uehaj/semgrep` through 0.4.0). The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (until 1.0, option changes bump minor).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `~/.config/sys1grep/settings.json` holds the settings as JSON, one optional field per variable: `url`, `key`,
  `model`, `opts` (an array, one argument each), `summarizer`, `summarizerModel`, `summarizerKey`. The command line
  wins, then the environment, then settings.json, then `~/.config/sys1grep/.env`, then the defaults. An environment
  variable set to empty counts as unset and falls through to settings.json, except `SYS1GREP_OPTS=`, which still
  drops the default options. Every environment variable works as before.
  A wrong type or a file that is not JSON is an error naming the file and the field, never a value; an unknown field
  only warns (so an older sys1grep keeps working once a newer one adds a field) and is ignored. A key in a file
  others can read gets a warning. `--verbose` / `--dry-run` name a value's field and the file
  (`key: key (~/.config/sys1grep/settings.json)`, `(settings.json opts)`). The no-key error points at the file.
- `-r` (and git sys1grep) now also skips `~/.config/sys1grep/settings.json` by its one known path, not by name: its
  basename matches no existing skip pattern, so a recursive search whose scope happened to reach it (e.g. `-r` over
  `$HOME`) would otherwise hand a match on the saved key to whatever reads the results.
- `--serve`: every route, the page itself included, now needs the launch's token (`?k=...` in the printed URL, carried
  on every request the page makes): without it the server answers 404 to everything, so another local account or
  process cannot read the page, its token, or a search's results merely by knowing the port.
- `--serve`: a Settings panel edits `~/.config/sys1grep/settings.json` and saves it for the next search. Each field says
  where the value in effect comes from (command line, environment variable, settings.json, `.env`, default), so a save
  that an environment variable would override says so. A key is only ever sent in, never shown as saved/not-saved; a
  `--sys1-api-key` inside `opts`, and a `url`'s userinfo, come back masked as `***` (as `--verbose` masks them), and
  resending a masked value unchanged does not overwrite the real one. `opts` refuses a target, a flag `--serve` itself
  refuses at launch, or `--sys1-url` / `--sys1-api-key` (their own fields); `url` and a URL summarizer must be
  `http(s)`. Saving is a `POST` with the page's token and this request's own Host as the required `Origin`; the file
  is written whole at 0600 (directory 0700 when created) and renamed into place, and a value that fails the file's
  checks is refused.
- `--format=html` marks what matched with `<mark>` (the regex matches, else the matching sentences, else the whole matching line);
  `--color=never` turns it off. `--serve` shows the colors of `--color=always` on the matches in file order, and the marks on the cards, by default.
- `--serve[=PORT]` serves a search page on `127.0.0.1` (#166): a box for the meanings, `--rank` / `--summarize` and the other
  options as controls, results as the `--rank --format=html` cards, and the command line for the current controls with a Copy
  button. Each search runs sys1grep with the launch options plus the controls' changes. `node:http` only.
- `--serve`: a multi-step switch takes the place of the `--step-to:` field kind. On, it shows the ends (`--step-to`, one or
  more meanings) and the edges (`--hops`, `--reverse`); off, they leave the command line and the search. Example buttons turn it
  on with a walk filled in. A meaning field added with `+` is now searched (it was read from its remove button).
- `--serve`: eight example buttons for ordinary searches, from the README and docs/use-cases.md (a meaning, `-Q`, two
  meanings with `-p`, `-v`, a regex with a meaning, `--level strict`, `--dedup`, `--unit=sentence-by-jev`), before the
  multi-step ones. Each fills the fields and the controls it needs, puts the rest back to their launch values (a plain
  example turns multi-step off), and sends nothing until Search.
- `-r` and `git sys1grep` warn before sending a large tree through a term no regex narrows (#138). When such a
  term is about to send more than 10,000 units, one stderr line before the judging requests gives the totals
  `--dry-run` would (units, files, estimated input tokens and, for TypeSafe itself, the price), names the term and
  suggests `-a '/RE/'`, `--include` / `--changed-within` or `--dry-run`. The run goes on: it is a warning, not a
  refusal. `-q` silences it, `-y` does not; `--dry-run` and `-i` show the same totals already and do not print it.
  A negated regex does not narrow its term, and a regex in another OR term (`-e '/RE/' -e MEANING`) does not
  narrow this one.
- A meaning may start with a dash on any search, not only around `--step-to`: `-e "--summarize hands the lines on"`, and the same for `-a`, `-v` and `-Q`. An option holds no space; a value that starts with `-` and is not an option is taken as the meaning.
- Multi-step matching: `EXPRESSION --step-to EXPRESSION` finds the functions the expression before `--step-to`
  matches, walks the calls from them breadth first, and prints the paths to the reached functions the expression
  after it matches, as a tree of hop, `file:line` and name (#163). No score steers the walk: Jev judges every function
  against the start expression in one batch and the functions reached within `--hops=N|M..N|M..` against the end in another;
  regex-only ends send nothing. `--edges=FILE` walks any other relation between lines, `--reverse` walks
  backwards. stderr gives the functions reached at each hop and why the walk stopped. `--max-cost` counts both
  batches, and `--dry-run` shows a bound. Refused with `-z`, `-g`, `-o`, `-c`, `-l`, `-A/-B/-C`, `--rank`,
  `--summarize` and `--dedup`.
- `--rank[=jev|match]` prints the results best first, each under a numbered header (`1. FILE`, `1. [SCORE] FILE`
  with `-p`), a blank line between them (#118). A result is a match with its `-A/-B/-C` lines; matches whose
  context touches are one. `--rank` is `--rank=jev`: after the search Jev is asked, one question per result,
  whether the result is relevant to the meanings that are not negated; `--rank=match` sorts by the result's
  highest match probability, with no request. `-l` lists files by their best result, `--summarize` gets the
  results ranked, and with `--dedup` a representative is one result. `--dry-run` / `-i` show an upper bound on
  the extra requests. It needs a meaning, and is refused with `-c`, `-o` and `-q`; `--no-rank` turns off an
  earlier one.
- `--format=plain|markdown|html` also shapes `--rank`'s output: sys1grep writes a `## N. FILE` heading and a fenced
  block per result, or one HTML document (from a template, below), escaped and uncolored.
  Anywhere but `--rank` and `--summarize` it is an error on the command line and unused in `SYS1GREP_OPTS`.
- `--rank --format=html` writes its document from a template (#158). The default is a self-contained page (no
  outside requests) with light and dark colors, a relevance bar per result, the top result set apart, and a print
  style; `print`, `search` (a web search engine's results page) and `terminal` are bundled too. `--template=NAME` reads `~/.config/sys1grep/templates/NAME.html`,
  else the bundled one, or takes a file path; `SYS1GREP_TEMPLATE` sets the default. A template is one HTML file
  whose `<!--result-->` ... `<!--/result-->` part repeats per result, with `{{title}}`, `{{query}}`, `{{count}}`,
  `{{rank}}`, `{{score}}`, `{{score_pct}}`, `{{file}}` and `{{lines}}` filled in escaped. `--template=list` prints
  the names, `--install-templates` copies the bundled ones there without overwriting; both take no other
  arguments and are refused in `SYS1GREP_OPTS`. A missing or broken template
  is exit 2 naming the file.
- `--template` also applies to `--summarize --format=html`. The TOOL is asked for plain text instead of a whole
  HTML document, and its answer goes, escaped, into the template's `{{answer}}` (empty with `--rank`) once the
  TOOL is done; the `<!--result-->` part is not written. A template used with `--summarize` must have `{{answer}}`
  outside that part, or it is exit 2. The bundled `default`, `print` and `terminal` have it.
- `--no-summarize` turns off an earlier `--summarize`, and `SYS1GREP_OPTS` now takes `--summarize` and `--rank`
  (both used to be refused there, having no `--no-` form to undo them for `-l` / `-c`). A `--summarize` in
  `SYS1GREP_OPTS` sends every search's matches to TOOL's provider too.
- `--unit=function` judges each function and prints its lines (#114). A function runs from a funcname line to
  the line before the next, as `git grep -W`: `diff=<driver>` and `diff.<driver>.xfuncname` pick the funcname
  lines, else sys1grep's own rule for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, else git's default (a line starting with a
  letter, `_` or `$`). `-M` defaults to 8000; `-z`, `-g` and `-o` are refused.
- Guards against generated and oversized input (#58, with the owner's decisions on #125's review applied). `-r`
  and `git sys1grep` now also skip generated files (`*.map`, `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `package-lock.json` and other
  lock files), named explicitly still searched. Every target is sized (`--max-filesize`, K/M/G, default 10M)
  before anything is read; one over it is skipped outright, like `rg`'s own `--max-filesize`
  (`sys1grep: big.log: skipped, 25 MB is over --max-filesize=10M`), named on stderr, and `-y` does not affect it
  (a named file over the limit is skipped too). Separately, the input about to be sent (including the setup
  requests above, if any ran) is priced (`--max-cost`, default 1 USD) and asks to continue on the terminal if it
  is over; the price is Jev's unless the URL is local or the model has its own price (see Changed), and the
  question says whose.
  `-y`/`--yes` answers that question yes without asking, and without a terminal a limit exceeded is exit 2.
  `-i` already asks unconditionally and earlier, so this does not ask again; `--dry-run` and `-i` show the same
  verdict. `-M`/`--max-columns` (default 2000, 8000 with `-z`) is unchanged from before this PR: it bounds only
  what is sent, truncating a unit to its first NUM characters; the unit is still searched and judged on that
  truncated text. Standard input is sized once it is read (it is already read whole into memory), and skipped
  the same way as a file (`sys1grep: -: skipped, 190 KB is over --max-filesize=10K`), nothing from it sent.
  `-g`'s commits stay out of `--max-filesize` (each is already bounded by `-M` at send time). `-q` combined with
  `--max-cost` and no terminal is unchanged: still an exit-2 stop (scripts pass `-y`). A `--cached` or `<tree>:`
  target (#50/#126) is a blob, not a file `stat` can size; `--max-filesize` now sizes it from its content
  instead, read once already by the batch `git cat-file --batch` those options use, so no extra `git` process
  runs per blob (#58 closes).
- `git sys1grep` gets `--cached`, `--untracked` and `<tree>...`, as `git grep` has them (#50). `--cached`
  searches the blobs staged in the index instead of the working tree (a file deleted from the working tree
  but still staged is still found); `--untracked` searches tracked files plus untracked ones (`.gitignore`
  still applies); a `<tree>...` (a branch, tag, commit or `@{u}`, named before `--`) searches that revision's
  tree instead, several may be given, each line prefixed `<tree>:` with the name as typed. Only one of the
  three at a time. A blob shared by several trees is judged once, without needing `--dedup`. Auto-scope does
  not narrow a blob (index or tree) target, and `--changed-within` is an error with `--cached` or a `<tree>`:
  a blob has no mtime of its own. A `<tree>`'s own pathspec takes a glob too, same as elsewhere in sys1grep
  (`git diff-tree` against the empty tree, not `git ls-tree`'s own literal/directory-prefix match). An
  argument before `--` that is both a tree and a path is `ambiguous argument '…': both revision and filename;
  use -- to separate`; one that is neither is `ambiguous argument '…': unknown revision or path not in the
  working tree` — the two messages `git` itself gives.
  `--verbose` / `--dry-run` (and `-i`'s preview) list `--cached`, `--untracked` or the `<tree>`s among the options,
  and a `--cached` file line reads `file PATH (index): ...`; `--summarize` pipes the `<tree>:` prefixes, and its
  prompt says what `REV:path` is (or that the files are the index copy).
- A file named `*.gz` is read decompressed, as `zgrep` does, and printed by its name on disk (#68): rotated logs
  (`app.log.1.gz`) are searched in place and under `-r`; `--include='*.gz'` picks them. The binary sniff
  sees the decompressed bytes, so a gzipped binary is still skipped; a gzipped secret (`private.key.gz`, `.netrc.gz`) is
  skipped like the plain one; a corrupt `.gz` is an unreadable file.
  Only gzip, only by the name; stdin is not decompressed. `--max-filesize` measures a `.gz` decompressed: zlib stops
  at the limit, so an oversized one is skipped without being inflated in full.
- `--verbose` / `--dry-run` print the settings the search ran with, before the per-file lines: the endpoint and
  model, the key (the variable or option name only, never its value), `SYS1GREP_OPTS` (when set), the effective
  thresholds / `--chunk` / `-j` / `--unit` / `--dedup` / `-z` / scope on-or-off / `--include` / `--exclude` /
  `--changed-within` / #58's `-M` / `--max-filesize` / `--max-cost` / `-y`, and, with `--summarize`, its TOOL and model (the TOOL's own default when unset), the key of a URL TOOL (by name) and whether `--summarize-prompt` is set. Each is marked with its source when it did not
  come from the command line: `(default)`, `(SYS1GREP_OPTS)`, `(ENV_NAME)`, or `(ENV_NAME, ~/.config/sys1grep/.env)`.
  `-i`'s preview shows the same lines (#90).
- `-g` / `--gitlog` searches the commits of `git log` instead of files, one record each (`%h %ad %s`, then the
  body). With one term, auto-scope turns into git log's arguments: a time into `--since`, a language into
  pathspecs, an author or "mine" into `--author`, this branch or not pushed into a range, so
  `sys1grep -g -Q '今日、.mjsにおこなった性能向上の修正'` runs `git log --since=<today> -- '*.mjs' …` and judges
  those commits. The command is printed on stderr. FILE arguments are pathspecs and are never narrowed. Places
  and uncommitted / staged / untracked are not asked. Not with `-r` or `git sys1grep`.
  A span with an end (yesterday, last week, last month) also gets `--until`, and wins over the rolling span of
  about the same length Jev says yes to as well (yesterday over the last 24 hours, whose start moves with the
  clock), so `昨日のバグ修正` judges yesterday's commits only (#120). Files are still narrowed by a span's start
  alone: a later change moves the mtime.
- Auto-scope's note (#111): each judging request tells Jev which scopes all its lines got through, in one
  `note` in its state (`note: every line here is from what was changed yesterday, .mjs files.`), named as the
  scope question named them, or a language by the extension the meaning wrote. A line cannot show when it
  changed, where it lives or who wrote it, so those words in a meaning pulled the verdicts down: on 49 lines,
  "昨日変更された、例外を処理している箇所" went from F1 0.00 to 1.00 at 0.5. `--verbose` shows the note under each request.
- `--summarize[=TOOL]` pipes what would print to an LLM CLI, asked about the meanings as they were written, and
  prints its answer instead of the lines (#69, #75). TOOL is `claude` (`claude -p --model haiku` with no tools and
  no settings); `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER` picks the TOOL of a bare `--summarize`, `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` its
  model. The matching lines are sent a second time, to the TOOL's provider. `--dry-run` shows the command.
  With `--dedup` the TOOL gets each template's representative once, marked `(×N like it)`; more than 200 KB is
  not sent at all (exit 2), never cut short (#98).
- `--summarize-prompt=TEXT` adds the user's own instruction after `--summarize`'s fixed one (#88). Needs
  `--summarize`; empty TEXT is the same as none.
- `--summarize=ollama` / `--summarize=lmstudio` / `--summarize=http(s)://...` send the same request straight to
  an OpenAI-compatible chat server by `fetch`, no CLI, so the matching lines never leave the machine a second
  time with a local server (#76). All three need `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` (no default model);
  `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY` goes as `Authorization: Bearer` to a URL TOOL only, never `SYS1GREP_API_KEY`.
  `OLLAMA_HOST` moves `ollama`'s host.
- `--summarize=llm` runs Simon Willison's `llm -n -s PROMPT` (`-m` too, with `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`); tools
  stay off since sys1grep never passes `-T` / `--functions` (#77).
- `--summarize=pi` runs `pi --print --no-tools --no-session --no-context-files --no-extensions --no-skills
  --no-prompt-templates --thinking off --system-prompt PROMPT` (`--model` too, with `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`)
  (#78). `codex`, `opencode` and `fm` stayed out: research on #78.
- `--format=plain|markdown|html` with `--summarize` asks for the answer's format, plain (no Markdown) by default
  (#122; `--summarize-format` until it also shaped `--rank`'s output). The format sentence goes before
  `--summarize-prompt`'s TEXT, so TEXT can still override it.
- On a terminal, a one-line spinner on stderr while sys1grep waits for Jev (`12 of 149 requests`) or the summarizer,
  drawn after 300 ms and erased before any output (#89). Not with `-q`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose` or `TERM=dumb`,
  and never when stderr is not a terminal, so scripts see exactly what they saw before.
- On a terminal, a regex term's matches are in grep's match color (bold red): every match on the line, for the terms
  that held, never a negated regex.
- `-o` without `--unit=sentence-by-*` prints each regex match on a line of its own, as `grep -o`, with no context. A line only
  meanings matched prints whole. Before, `-o` without `--sentence` was ignored.
- The `--dry-run` summary line (also shown by `-i`) estimates the input tokens and, for TypeSafe itself, the price:
  `…, 2315 chars, ~3178 input tokens, ~$0.000133; nothing sent`. The estimate is 650 tokens a request plus 0.21 a
  request-body byte, fitted on real requests in English and Japanese; it was within -8% to +12% of what Jev billed.
- Auto-scope (#43): with `-r` and `git sys1grep`, each meaning first asks Jev, in one small request, whether it
  restricts its matches to a language or format (26 of them) or to what changed within a span (the last minute
  … this fiscal year, 14 of them); a yes at 0.6 or more searches only those files. Per term, reported on stderr as
  `sys1grep: scope: …` with Jev's answer, silent with `-q`, asked only after `-i`'s answer; named files are never
  narrowed. `--no-auto-scope` turns it off, `--auto-scope` back on.
  `--verbose` lists each candidate Jev answered 0.2 or more, with its answer, ✓ if applied or · if not, and how
  many of the files found it alone keeps (#99). It also names, once per file with a match, the scopes that file got
  through (`sys1grep: src/app.py: searched by scope Python files (*.py *.pyi *.pyw)`), and after `scope: N of M files`
  the files left out, 10 by name and the rest counted (`sys1grep:   left out: README.md … (+325 more)`) (#104).
- Auto-scope by place (#48): test code, migrations, the README, the changelog, documentation, source code (what is
  not documentation) and logs, by path conventions, asked of Jev with the other candidates.
- Auto-scope from git (#46): in a repository a time goes by commits (uncommitted files by their mtime), and git
  states (uncommitted, staged, untracked, this branch, not pushed, mine) and the 30 most active authors are
  candidates too. One git process per repository and question.
- `--dedup=auto` (#143): before anything is sent, `--dedup` locally estimates the best case (every kind
  folded) and, when folding would save at least twice the cost of its own question, asks and folds; otherwise
  it sends every unit, asking nothing extra. `--verbose` / `--dry-run` print the decision and its numbers
  (units, templates, requests, tokens) for every `--dedup` value.

### Changed
- The price shown and checked by `--max-cost` (`--dry-run`, the large-send warning, the question, the summary line)
  depends on the URL and the model: a local URL (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, by the host as typed, only for a
  URL you set) is free, so `--max-cost` asks about nothing there and no longer stops a run without a terminal; a
  model in the table is priced at its own price (`jev-latest` 0.042, `clef` 0.24, `clef-flash` 0.09 USD per M input
  tokens); any other model at Jev's 0.042. For another URL the price says whose it is (`at TypeSafe's list price`,
  `at clef's list price`, `(local URL, free)`). Before, a custom URL was priced at Jev's list price whatever it was
  (the owner's decision of 2026-09-27, replaced on 2026-10-06). An endpoint that reports `usage.cost` still shows that.
- `--dedup` takes `auto`, `always` or `never` (#143); a bare `--dedup` is `--dedup=always`, unchanged from
  before. **Default is `never` for now**, kept off until real-run stats say `auto` should be the default; a
  run that would have paid to fold prints one stderr hint naming `--dedup=auto` (not with `-q`, gated like the
  summary line). `--dedup` no longer being a boolean flag, `--no-dedup` is now an error, like any other
  string option's `--no-` form (`--no-level`, `--no-unit`).
- `--unit=line|zero|sentence-by-jev|sentence-by-rule` chooses the unit of judgement (#140). `--sentence` is gone:
  `--sentence` / `--sentence=jev` is now `--unit=sentence-by-jev`, `--sentence=rules` is `--unit=sentence-by-rule`.
  `-z` / `--null-data` stay, as `--unit=zero`, and still combine with the sentence units to split each record into
  sentences.
- `--unit=sentence-by-*` colors the matching sentence bold yellow instead of bold red, so a regex match inside it stands out.

### Renamed
`semgrep` collided with the trademarked static-analysis tool [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) (#93).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-26

### Security
- The `-r` / `git semgrep` skip list matched only `.env` and `.env.<x>`, though the help promised `.env*`: `.envrc`,
  `.env-local` and `.env_prod` were sent, and so were `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.pgpass`, `.git-credentials`,
  `id_rsa_work` and `.kube` / `.docker`. It now skips them all, comparing names without case.
- `-r` inside a git repository skips what git ignores (`.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, the global excludes
  file), so build output and local files are not sent. Tracked files are searched even if they match. A file or
  directory named on the command line is searched even if git ignores it.
- **Breaking:** `./.env` in the current directory is no longer read, as in 0.3.1 (see there).

### Fixed
- A PDF is skipped as binary. One that opens with XML metadata has no NUL in the first 8 KB, so its bytes were
  sent as lines.
- UTF-16 with a BOM is read as text. Its NUL bytes made it look binary, so it was skipped, silently with `-r`.
- A malformed API response (an answer without a probability) is an error (exit 2). It used to count as 0, so
  `-v X` and `!X` matched. An error body from the server is cut to 300 characters, without control characters.
- `-q` exits 0 on a match even when another request failed, and decides a regex match before `--dedup` asks anything.
- A directory without `-r`, or one `-r` cannot read, is reported and skipped; the rest is still searched (exit 2).
- `-o -n` without `--sentence` no longer crashes. `-A`/`-B`/`-C`/`--chunk`/`-j` take whole numbers only.
  `--color` is checked before any request.
- With `-z`, a binary file (other control bytes than NUL) is skipped; a binary named on the command line is reported.
- Regex captures placed in a question are cut to 200 characters and their quotes escaped.
- `--sentence=jev` with regex terms only joins lines by the rules and sends nothing.
- A warning when the API key goes to a non-local `http://` endpoint.
- Docs: `--chunk` changes results, not just speed. Lines in one request are each other's context, so
  ambiguous lines can flip with a small chunk (`--chunk 1` flipped 18 of 200 log lines). The README said
  batching did not change the probabilities (#9).

### Changed
- **Requires Node.js 20.16 or later** (was 20.12), for `parseArgs`' `--no-X`, which `SEMGREP_OPTS` needs.
- Docs: examples outside the cross-language section are in English; a FAQ on the combinations that replace
  `--paragraph`, on jsonl and on `--record-separator`; a landing page on GitHub Pages, and three of its scenes as an animated SVG at
  the top of the README (`scripts/demo-svg.mjs` renders it from the page).
- Tests: an offline suite against a fake Jev (`tests/offline.sh`, no key, no network); `npm test` runs it first.
  `npm run judge` passes `./.env` explicitly; `scripts/release.sh` checks `gh auth` before publishing and runs
  `npm test`.

### Added
- `--dry-run`: send nothing; print to stdout the endpoint, each file searched (its units and how many would be
  sent) and each request with its questions, grouped by wording. The `--dedup` and `--sentence` questions are
  answered no, so those counts are an estimate. `-q` is ignored, so the list is complete. Control characters in file names
  and contents show as `\xNN`, so a crafted name cannot redraw the terminal.
- `--verbose`: the same lines on stderr while searching, and the summary line even when stderr is not a terminal.
- `-V`, `--version`: print `semgrep X.Y.Z` and exit, like `grep -V`.
- `-H`, `--with-filename`: prefix each line, and each `-c` count, with its file name even for a single file, as
  editors expect (Vim's `grepprg`, Emacs `M-x grep`). `--no-filename`: never, even with several files, `-r` or
  `git semgrep`. The later one wins, and either can sit in `SEMGREP_OPTS` (#52).
- `-i`, `--interactive`: first run the same command as `--dry-run`, show its files and totals on the terminal, and
  search only when the answer is `y`. Nothing is sent before the answer; any other answer exits 1. The answer is
  read from `/dev/tty`, so data can still come on stdin; without a terminal it is an error (exit 2), which names
  `SEMGREP_OPTS` when `-i` came from there. A file the dry run could not read is listed next to the question.
- `--include=GLOB`, `--exclude=GLOB`: with `-r` and `git semgrep`, only files whose name matches (or does not match)
  a shell glob; both can be repeated, as in grep. A glob with a `/` warns, since it is matched against the name only;
  an unclosed `[` is an error naming the option. `*` also matches a leading dot, as in `rg --glob`.
  `--changed-within=WHEN`: only files modified within `30m`, `2h`, `7d`, `2w`; since a date (`2026-09-01`, local
  midnight) or an ISO date-time; or `today`, `this-week` (from Monday) or `this-month`, in local time. A day its
  month lacks (`2026-02-30`) is an error; a future time warns. By mtime, not git history: after a clone or
  checkout every file it wrote counts as just changed. With `-r` a file named on the
  command line is always searched; `git semgrep`'s pathspecs are filtered like the rest.
- `SEMGREP_OPTS`: default options from the environment, split on spaces and put before the command line, which
  wins. `--no-X` turns a boolean flag off (`--color` takes `--color=never`). Options only: no meanings, files or
  `--`. A script can run `SEMGREP_OPTS= semgrep` to ignore it (#23).
- `git semgrep`: a `git-semgrep` command, so git runs it as a subcommand. Like `git grep`, it searches the tracked
  files, and FILE arguments are pathspecs. The `-r` skip list (`.env*`, keys, ...) still applies.
- `--sys1-model=ID`, `--sys1-url=URL`, `--sys1-api-key=KEY`: the API settings on the command line, overriding
  `SEMGREP_MODEL`, `SEMGREP_URL` and `SEMGREP_API_KEY`. Also allowed in `SEMGREP_OPTS`.
- `-Q`, `--question QUESTION`: matches lines that answer the question, not lines asking it. Shorthand for
  `-e "the line answers: QUESTION"`. "the cat's name" matches a line stating it, not a line asking for it;
  for a yes/no question ("whether the server is down") a line that denies it still answers it and matches.
  Closes #22.
- `-q`, `--quiet`: print nothing and report only through the exit status, like `grep -q`. Stops at the first
  match, so the remaining lines are not sent. A match exits 0 even if another file could not be read.
- `--sentence`: judge each sentence instead of each line. Output is still the lines a matching sentence
  touches, with the sentence in the match color. Wrapped lines are joined first, except at a blank line,
  next to brackets or `;`, or before a line starting with `-` `*` `+` `#` `>` `"` or a digit, so JSONL,
  lists and code keep their line boundaries. Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Myanmar and Tibetan join
  without a space. Sentences are cut by `Intl.Segmenter`. With `-z`, each record is split on its own.
  Prompted by #5 by @nedzen.
- `--sentence[=HOW]`: with `jev` (the default), unpunctuated breaks next to those scripts are also asked to
  Jev (30 lines per request, a yes/no per break, kept apart at 0.7 or more), so one-line entries that end
  without `。` are not glued together. `rules` uses the rules only, with no extra requests. A line starting
  with closing punctuation (`。、」』）！？`) or following a line that ends in `、` always joins.
- `-o`: with `--sentence`, print only the matching sentences, one per line, numbered by their first line.
- `--dedup`: judge one line (record, sentence) per template. Ids, hashes, numbers, dates and times, paths
  and URLs are masked for grouping only; the representative's original text is sent and its answer is
  reused for the group. Jev is first asked, once per meaning, which of those kinds could change a match,
  and those are kept apart (#8, #19). The stderr summary reads `N sent of M`.
  With regex terms, `--dedup` groups after the prefilter: regex terms are matched on every unit, never
  taken from a representative, and units whose referenced captures differ are judged apart (#25).
- `-e`/`-a`/`-v '/pattern/flags'`: a regex term, matched locally with no request at all. It prefilters its
  AND term, so only the units it holds for ever ask that term's meanings. Its named and numbered groups pass
  to the term's meanings as `$<name>`, `$1`-`$99`, `$&`, `$$` (ECMAScript's `GetSubstitution`, with one
  deviation: `$<name>` naming no group, or a negated regex's group, is an error). `-p` prints `1.00`/`0.00`
  for a regex term.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-25

### Security
- **Breaking:** `./.env` in the current directory is no longer read; only the environment and
  `~/.config/semgrep/.env` are. A `.env` committed to an untrusted repository could set `SEMGREP_URL` and send
  the API key and the searched text to another server. Load a per-project file explicitly with `node --env-file`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-24

_(first npm release since 0.2.0: also carries 0.2.2, which was tagged but never published)_

### Added
- `-z` / `--null-data`: the unit of judgement becomes a NUL-terminated record instead of a line, so a
  record may span several lines. Matching records are printed NUL-terminated too, as in `grep -z`; file
  names and counts stay on newlines. `-n` numbers records, `-A`/`-B`/`-C` count records, `--chunk` counts
  records. Pairs directly with `git log -z`, `find -print0` and `xargs -0`, removing the two `tr` calls
  previously needed to flatten a record onto one line (#6).
- Other endpoints: `SEMGREP_URL` and `SEMGREP_MODEL` point semgrep at any TypeSafe-compatible `/v1/systemone`
  (OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, a local server). Based on #4 by @nedzen.
- The summary line shows cost: the endpoint's `usage.cost` when reported, else for TypeSafe an estimate marked `~`.

### Changed
- The API key is now `SEMGREP_API_KEY`; `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` still works when it is not set. The key is sent to
  `SEMGREP_URL` as is; with `SEMGREP_URL` set and no key, no Authorization header is sent.
- **Breaking:** `SEMGREP_ENV` is gone. `./.env` then `~/.config/semgrep/.env` are still read.
- Network errors name the endpoint's host instead of `typesafe`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-20

_(tagged only; not published to npm. Its changes reached npm in 0.3.0)_

_(includes what was briefly tagged v0.2.1; that tag was never published and has been removed)_

### Changed
- README: install section now presents the two ways to use it (command-line tool, Claude Code skill),
  and notes that the skill falls back to `npx` so no install is needed for skill-only use.
- README: "Use it from Claude Code" section for the `/uehaj:semgrep` skill (`uehaj/skills` marketplace),
  including single-skill install via the skills CLI.
- README: cross-lingual section now shows French, Russian, German, Spanish, Chinese and Korean, not just Japanese and English.
- Source comments translated to English.
- Added `RELEASING.md` and `scripts/release.sh` (`npm run release <bump>`).

### Added
- `tests/multi.txt`, `tests/fairy*.txt`, `tests/guild*.txt` corpora.

### Fixed
- `tests/judge.mts` no longer depends on `-T 1.01`, which the new range check rejects.
- `-c` prints `0` for files without a match, like grep.
- `-r` prefixes file names even when only one file is searched, like `grep -r`.
- Unreadable files are reported and skipped; the rest of the input is still searched; exit code is 2.
- Empty meanings (`-e ''`) are rejected.
- Help text: exit code 2 covers all errors, not only bad arguments.

### Changed
- `-r` skips `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `id_rsa`-style keys and `.ssh` / `.aws` / `.gnupg`,
  since every searched line is sent to the TypeSafe API. A file named explicitly is still searched.
- Blank lines are not sent to the API; they count as probability 0 for every meaning, so `-v X` prints them
  and `-e X` never does (grep -v semantics).
- The stderr summary line is printed only when stderr is a terminal.
- `docs/` is included in the npm package so the README image resolves.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `-c` now means "count matching lines per file" (grep -c). Lines per request moved to `--chunk=LINES`.
- `-t` / `-T` must be between 0 and 1.
- `-r` keeps the leading `./` in file names.

### Fixed
- Output no longer truncated when stdout is a pipe (`process.exitCode` instead of `process.exit()`).
- `--chunk 0` and `-j 0` no longer hang.
- `fetch` has a 60 s timeout; connection errors and 5xx are retried with backoff like 429 / 529.
- `-r` skips symbolic links (no infinite loops).
- `-C=10` and similar are rejected with a clear message instead of silently matching nothing.

### Added
- `tests/check.sh` covers `-l`, `-c`, `-r`, `-C`, out-of-range thresholds and `-C=1`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-19

### Added
- `--help` in English, or Japanese when `LC_ALL` / `LC_MESSAGES` / `LANG` starts with `ja`.
- README: `npx @uehaj/semgrep` usage.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-19

First release as `@uehaj/semgrep`.

### Added
- Semantic grep: one `noul` question per line and meaning against TypeSafe Jev, 30 lines per request, 8 requests in parallel.
- Expression grammar: `-e` (OR), `-a` (AND), `-v` (AND NOT), `!MEANING` for per-meaning negation.
- Thresholds: `-t` (positive), `-T` (negative), presets `--level loose|normal|strict`.
- grep-compatible options: `-n`, `-r`, `-l`, `-A` / `-B` / `-C`, `--color[=WHEN]` (honors `NO_COLOR`).
- `-p` prints each meaning's probability, colored against the thresholds.
- API key lookup: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `$SEMGREP_ENV`, `./.env`, `~/.config/semgrep/.env`.
- Errors are one line plus exit code 2, no stack traces.
- LLM-as-judge test (`tests/judge.mts`) with threshold sweep; self-check (`tests/check.sh`).
