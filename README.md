# sys1grep — System 1 for your files; uses TypeSafe AI's Jev

[日本語版はこちら](README.ja.md)

Background and design notes (Japanese): [Jevのキラーアプリ、「意味で探す grep」を作った](https://zenn.dev/uehaj/articles/jev-semgrep-grep-by-meaning) on Zenn.

> **Renamed from semgrep (0.5.0).** Two reasons. The name collided with the static-analysis tool [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a trademark. And the tool was never meant for Jev alone: it targets System 1 models in general, and I'd like it to work with any models TypeSafe AI may release after Jev under other names :). So from 0.5.0 this is **sys1grep** (System 1 + grep): npm package `@uehaj/sys1grep` (was `@uehaj/semgrep`), commands `sys1grep` / `git sys1grep`, environment `SYS1GREP_*`, config `~/.config/sys1grep/.env`. The old `SEMGREP_*` names and `~/.config/semgrep/.env` still work for one minor release, each use printing a deprecation line; 1.0.0 drops them. Details: [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#renamed). The Zenn article's URL keeps its old slug.

A grep that finds lines by **what they mean**, not by regular expressions.
Matching is done by **Jev**, the System One model from [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai/).
Jev does not generate text. It answers typed questions with probabilities, so for every line
sys1grep asks "does this line match the meaning *network failure*?", gets a probability back,
and applies a threshold.

```sh
./sys1grep -n -e "customer is angry or frustrated" tickets.txt
```

[![sys1grep demo: a Japanese meaning finds refund requests in six languages; "asking for a refund" vs "about a refund"; -Q finds the answer](docs/demo.svg)](https://sys1grep.js.org/)

- Zero dependencies. One file, Node.js 20.16+ and `fetch`.
- Fast. 30 lines go into one request, requests run 8 at a time. A 210-line file finishes in under a second.
- Meanings combine with AND / OR / NOT.
- **Language-agnostic.** The meaning and the text can each be in any language. A Japanese meaning finds French, Russian, Chinese and Korean lines alike. No translation step, same speed, same cost.

## Search across languages

The meaning and the text do not have to share a language. Jev compares concepts, not words,
so one query finds matching lines in every language the file contains.

An **English** meaning finds **Japanese** lines. None of the hits contain "angry" or "frustrated", and two of them are in Japanese:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "customer is angry or frustrated" tests/corpus.txt
14:ユーザー山田さんからの問い合わせ: 返金してほしい、商品が壊れていた
16:ユーザー佐藤さんからの問い合わせ: 注文した覚えのない請求が来ています。至急確認してください
18:I want my money back. The item arrived broken and customer service ignored me.
21:Your product ruined my weekend. Never buying from you again.
23:This is the third time I'm writing. Nobody has replied to my previous emails.
```

A **Japanese** meaning finds **English** lines, with the same confidence as the Japanese ones:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -p -e "返金の要求" tests/corpus.txt
14:ユーザー山田さんからの問い合わせ: 返金してほしい、商品が壊れていた	[0.97]
18:I want my money back. The item arrived broken and customer service ignored me.	[0.95]
```

It is not a Japanese/English feature. `tests/multi.txt` holds refund requests and thank-you notes in French,
Russian, German, Spanish, Chinese and Korean. One Japanese meaning finds all six refund requests; a Russian
meaning does the same:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -p -e "顧客が返金を求めている" tests/multi.txt
1:Je veux être remboursé, le produit est arrivé cassé.	[0.98]
3:Я требую вернуть деньги, товар не работает.	[0.97]
5:Ich möchte mein Geld zurück, das Gerät ist defekt.	[0.97]
7:Quiero un reembolso, el paquete llegó vacío.	[0.97]
9:我要求退款，商品坏了。	[0.97]
11:환불해 주세요. 제품이 고장났어요.	[0.97]

$ ./sys1grep -n -p -e "клиент требует возврат денег" tests/multi.txt
1:Je veux être remboursé, le produit est arrivé cassé.	[0.94]
3:Я требую вернуть деньги, товар не работает.	[0.97]
5:Ich möchte mein Geld zurück, das Gerät ist defekt.	[0.92]
7:Quiero un reembolso, el paquete llegó vacío.	[0.89]
9:我要求退款，商品坏了。	[0.92]
11:환불해 주세요. 제품이 고장났어요.	[0.89]
```

This makes sys1grep useful for mixed-language logs and ticket dumps, and for teams whose members
query in different languages. One caveat: TypeSafe documents English as the most accurate language,
and in our tests Japanese meanings wobble a little more near the threshold. When a query is borderline,
phrasing the meaning in English is the safer choice.

## How this differs from vector search

If all you want is "lines about X", embedding similarity gives you the same lines. sys1grep differs in
*what* it judges: not how close a line is to a topic, but whether a **proposition** holds for that line.
Jev reads the line and the question together (a cross-encoder shape), so who did what, negation, and
"asked for" versus "already done" all change the answer. An embedding of the line is fixed before it
ever sees your query, so it can only measure topical closeness.

All eight lines below are "about a refund" (the same contrast as `tests/contrast.txt`, translated to
English as `tests/contrast.en.txt` — see [Search across languages](#search-across-languages) above for
the case where the meaning and the text differ in language). Only two are a customer asking for one:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -p -t 0 -e "customer is asking for a refund" tests/contrast.en.txt
1:I want a refund. The item was broken.	[0.99]
2:The refund has been processed. Please check your account.	[0.11]
3:Our refund policy is within 30 days of purchase.	[0.09]
4:The manager denied the refund request yesterday	[0.17]
5:I demand a full refund immediately	[0.93]
6:Refunds are processed within 5 business days	[0.07]
7:The support agent got angry and hung up the phone.	[0.05]
8:The customer got angry and hung up the phone.	[0.06]
```

Because each meaning yields an independent probability, **logical AND and NOT are plain boolean
operations**, not a trick with set differences or "negative queries":

```sh
# about a refund, but NOT a customer asking for one → completed, policy, denied, timelines
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "about a refund" -v "the customer is asking for a refund" tests/contrast.en.txt
2:The refund has been processed. Please check your account.
3:Our refund policy is within 30 days of purchase.
4:The manager denied the refund request yesterday
6:Refunds are processed within 5 business days

# angry AND it is the customer, not the staff
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "someone is angry" -a "the customer, not the staff, is the one acting" tests/contrast.en.txt
5:I demand a full refund immediately
8:The customer got angry and hung up the phone.
```

Line 7, `The support agent got angry and hung up the phone.`, scores 0.05 on the second meaning and is
excluded, even though it differs from line 8 by one word (*support agent* vs. *customer*) — wording an
embedding would place right next to line 8's. (We could not reproduce a cosine-similarity number for
this pair: no embedding-model access was available in this environment, and no prior measurement script
exists in the repository or its history to rerun. The argument stands on the wording alone: an embedding
of line 7 has no way to see that "support agent" changes who the sentence is about.)

Two more practical consequences. The probabilities are calibrated, so one threshold (0.5) works across
queries, where cosine scores need top-k or per-query tuning. And there is no index to build: sys1grep reads
the files in front of you. The flip side is that every query pays for the whole corpus again, so for
repeated queries over a large, fixed corpus a vector index is cheaper and faster.

## Regex terms

`-e`/`-a`/`-v '/pattern/flags'` (first and last character `/`, JavaScript flags) is matched locally,
as a plain regex, with no request at all. It prefilters its AND term: only the lines it holds for
ever ask that term's meanings, so a cheap regex in front of a meaning cuts both the bill and the wait. A line is sent
only if some term's regexes all hold for it (a term with no regex holds for every line), so with
`-e '/re/' -a A -e B` a line without `re` is still sent, asked `B` only. A query of regex terms alone
sends nothing, even with `--unit=sentence-by-jev`: the rules alone then decide where wrapped lines join. Anything that isn't shaped like `/…/flags` is still a meaning, so
`-e '/etc 以下のファイルを変更している'` (no closing `/`) is unaffected; a meaning that really starts
and ends with `/` can be written with a leading space to dodge the regex reading.

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -e '/ERROR|FATAL/' app.log                               # no requests at all
$ ./sys1grep -e '/timeout/i' -a '顧客に影響が出ている' app.log         # only lines with "timeout" go to Jev
```

A regex's named and numbered groups pass to the other meanings of the *same* AND term as
`$<name>`, `$1`-`$99`, `$&`, `$$` — ECMAScript's replacement-pattern syntax
(`String.prototype.replace`'s `GetSubstitution`), with one deviation: `$<name>` naming no group is
an error rather than an empty string (so is a reference to a negated regex's group). A `$n` naming
no group stays literal, as in ECMAScript, so `$100 以上の請求` is unaffected.

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -e '/(?<date>\d{4}-\d\d-\d\d) (?<time>\d\d:\d\d)/' \
            -a '$<time> が深夜（0時〜5時）であり、$<date> が週末である' app.log
#   2026-09-19 03:12 ... → asks "03:12 が深夜（0時〜5時）であり、2026-09-19 が週末である"
```

Prefer `$<name>` and single quotes: `$<name>` survives double quotes in sh/bash/zsh; `$1`, `$time`
and `${time}` don't (the shell expands them itself). `-p` prints `1.00`/`0.00` for a regex term.

On a terminal every match of a regex is in grep's match color (bold red), for the terms that held; a negated regex
is never colored. `-o` prints each match on a line of its own, as `grep -o`; a line only meanings matched prints
whole, since a meaning has no matching part.

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -o -n -e '/[A-Z]+-\d+/' -a 'the ticket is still open' notes.txt   # the ticket ids, one per line
```

## Sending less

Every line sent to Jev costs money and time, so the cheapest line is the one never sent. From the widest cut
to the narrowest:

- **Which files.** `-r` skips `.git`, `node_modules`, binary files, likely secrets, generated files (source maps,
  minified JS/CSS, lock files) and what git ignores; [`git sys1grep`](#as-a-git-subcommand-git-sys1grep) searches
  tracked files only. `--include` / `--exclude` (file-name globs) and `--changed-within` (`30m`, `7d`, `today`,
  `this-week`, a date) narrow them further. A meaning that restricts itself to a language or a time of change
  narrows them by itself: see [Scope from the meaning](#scope-from-the-meaning).
- **Which lines.** A [regex term](#regex-terms) is matched locally, and only the lines it holds for are asked
  its AND term's meanings. Blank lines are never sent. Only the first `-M`/`--max-columns` characters of a line
  (default 2000, 8000 with `-z`) are sent: it is still searched and judged, just not past that cutoff.
- **How many times.** [`--dedup`](#one-line-per-template---dedup) judges one line per template: lines that
  differ only in ids, numbers, times or paths share one answer. `auto`/`always`/`never`, off by default for
  now: a hint says when `--dedup=auto` would pay.
- **Check before paying.** `--dry-run` sends nothing and prints the settings the search would run with, the
  files, how many lines each would send and every request with its questions. Its last line estimates the input
  tokens and, for TypeSafe itself, the price (`~3178 input tokens, ~$0.000133`; within about 10%). `-i` shows the
  same totals on the terminal and sends only after `y`.
  Before the bulk of requests, every target is sized (`--max-filesize`, default 10M); one over it is skipped
  outright, like `rg`'s own `--max-filesize`, named on stderr (`-y` does not affect it). A `.gz` is sized
  decompressed (zlib stops at the limit, so an oversized one is never inflated in full). stdin is sized once it
  is read (it is already in memory), and skipped the same way if it is over; a `--cached` or `<tree>:` target
  is a blob rather than a file, sized from its content (already read in one `git cat-file --batch` call, not a
  fresh git process per blob); `-g`'s commits stay out of this, since each is already bounded by `-M` when it
  is sent. The input about to be sent is priced too (`--max-cost`,
  default 1 USD); over it, one question asks to continue on the terminal, `-y` answers it yes, and without a
  terminal it is exit 2 (this applies with `-q` too — scripts pass `-y`).
  With `-r` or `git sys1grep`, a term no regex narrows that is about to send more than 10,000 lines gets one
  stderr line with the same totals, naming the term (`sys1grep: sending 214,913 of 231,502 lines from 1,247 files
  (~9.1M input tokens, ~$0.38); the term "…" has no regex to narrow it. Add -a '/RE/' to it, …`). The search goes
  on; `-q` silences the line, `-y` does not.

```sh
$ sys1grep --dry-run -r --include='*.log' --changed-within=today -e '/ERROR|FATAL/' -a 'a customer is affected' logs/
```

`--verbose` (or `--dry-run`) also shows *where* a setting that was not typed on the command line came from
(`SYS1GREP_OPTS`, an environment variable, `~/.config/sys1grep/.env`, or a preset's default), so a result that
surprises you can be traced back to its source. The key's value never appears, only which option or variable
supplied it:

```sh
$ SYS1GREP_OPTS='--level strict' sys1grep --verbose -e "the API key is read from a file" .
sys1grep: endpoint api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone (default), model jev-latest (default)
sys1grep: key: SYS1GREP_API_KEY (~/.config/sys1grep/.env)
sys1grep: SYS1GREP_OPTS: --level strict
sys1grep: options: --level strict (SYS1GREP_OPTS) = -t 0.7 -T 0.3, --chunk 30, -j 8, scope on, -M 2000, --max-filesize 10M, --max-cost 1
sys1grep: file ./a.py: 120 lines, 120 to send
…
```

## Install

Two ways to use it: as a command-line tool (this section), or as a Claude Code skill
(see [Use it from Claude Code](#use-it-from-claude-code) below). The skill falls back to `npx @uehaj/sys1grep`,
so if you only use it through Claude Code you can skip the install here entirely and just set the API key.

Requires Node.js 20.16 or later. No other dependencies.

```sh
npm install -g @uehaj/sys1grep
sys1grep --help
```

To try it without installing, run it through `npx` (the first run downloads the package, later runs use the cache):

```sh
npx @uehaj/sys1grep -n -e "customer is angry or frustrated" tickets.txt
```

Then give it an API key from the [TypeSafe console](https://console.typesafe.ai/). Any one of these works:

```sh
export SYS1GREP_API_KEY=your-key                       # environment variable
echo 'SYS1GREP_API_KEY=your-key' > ~/.config/sys1grep/.env    # per user (mkdir -p first)
```

Variables already in the environment win; otherwise `~/.config/sys1grep/.env` fills them in. A `.env` in the current
directory is never read: it may belong to a repository you just cloned, and could send your key elsewhere through
`SYS1GREP_URL`. For per-project settings, load a file yourself: `node --env-file=.env "$(command -v sys1grep)" ...`.
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is accepted too when `SYS1GREP_API_KEY` is not set.

### Default options

`SYS1GREP_OPTS` holds options to apply on every call, read like the settings above. It is split on spaces and put in
front of the command line, so the command line wins: a later value counts, and `--no-X` turns a default flag off.

```sh
export SYS1GREP_OPTS='--level strict -j 8 -n'
sys1grep -e "payment failed" app.log                  # strict, 8 at once, line numbers
sys1grep --level loose --no-n -e "payment failed" app.log
```

A script calling sys1grep would pick these up too (grep dropped `GREP_OPTIONS` for that reason). Call it as
`SYS1GREP_OPTS= sys1grep ...` in scripts.

### Other endpoints

The API is configured by exactly three settings: `SYS1GREP_API_KEY` (or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`), `SYS1GREP_URL` and `SYS1GREP_MODEL`.
Any endpoint that speaks TypeSafe's `POST /v1/systemone` works. The key is sent to `SYS1GREP_URL` as is, so set the
two together. On the command line, `--sys1-model=ID`, `--sys1-url=URL` and `--sys1-api-key=KEY` override
the three. A key given this way shows up in `ps` and shell history, so prefer `~/.config/sys1grep/.env` for it.

```sh
# OpenRouter
SYS1GREP_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/systemone SYS1GREP_API_KEY=sk-or-... sys1grep -e ...
# Vercel AI Gateway
SYS1GREP_URL=https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/typesafe/v1/systemone SYS1GREP_MODEL=typesafe-ai/jev SYS1GREP_API_KEY=vck_... sys1grep -e ...
# A compatible server that needs no key: no Authorization header is sent
SYS1GREP_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1/systemone sys1grep -e ...
```

The summary line shows the cost the endpoint reports (`usage.cost`), or for TypeSafe itself an estimate at list
price marked `~`.

From source: `git clone https://github.com/uehaj/sys1grep.git && cd sys1grep && npm install -g .`,
or run it in place with `node sys1grep.mjs ...`.

## Examples

All examples run against [`tests/corpus.txt`](tests/corpus.txt), a 51-line mix of server logs,
support tickets in English and Japanese, source code, SQL and small talk. Where a Japanese line would
otherwise show up in the output below, this section instead uses [`tests/corpus.en.txt`](tests/corpus.en.txt),
the same 51 lines with the Japanese ones translated to English — the cross-language behaviour itself is
shown once, in [Search across languages](#search-across-languages) above.

### Find lines by a concept, in any language

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "customer is angry or frustrated" tests/corpus.en.txt
14:Inquiry from user Yamada: I want a refund, the item was broken
16:Inquiry from user Sato: I'm being charged for an order I never placed, it looks like fraud, please check urgently
18:I want my money back. The item arrived broken and customer service ignored me.
21:Your product ruined my weekend. Never buying from you again.
23:This is the third time I'm writing. Nobody has replied to my previous emails.
5 of 51 lines matched; 51 sent to Jev in 2 requests, 3054 input tokens, ~$0.000128
```

None of these lines contain the words "angry" or "frustrated".

### Lines that answer a question (`-Q`)

`-e` asks whether a line states a meaning. `-Q QUESTION` (`--question`) finds lines that answer it instead,
so you can write the question as you would ask it:

```sh
$ echo "The job failed." | ./sys1grep -e "Did the job succeed?"
$ echo "The job failed." | ./sys1grep -Q "Did the job succeed?"
The job failed.
```

As a meaning, "Did the job succeed?" is not what the line says (0.08), so `-e` finds nothing. As a question,
the line answers it: no, it failed (0.83). A line that *asks* the question is close to it in meaning but
answers nothing, and for a yes/no question a line that *denies* it still answers it:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -Q "whether the server is down" tests/intent.txt
5:The server is down.
6:The server is healthy and responding normally.
2 of 17 lines matched; 17 sent to Jev in 1 request, 1087 input tokens, ~$0.000046
```

Both the confirming line and the denying line match: each settles whether the server is down. `Is the
server down?` does not match, because asking is not answering; `-e "asking whether the server is down"`
would match it instead. `-Q X` is shorthand for `-e "the line answers: X"`, so it combines with `-a` / `-v`
/ `!` and OR's with other terms exactly like `-e`.

### OR: two meanings, and see the probabilities with `-p`

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -p -e "customer is asking for a refund" -e "delivery address change request" tests/corpus.en.txt
14:Inquiry from user Yamada: I want a refund, the item was broken	[0.99 0.01]
17:Inquiry from user Takahashi: I'd like to change the delivery address	[0.01 0.99]
18:I want my money back. The item arrived broken and customer service ignored me.	[0.96 0.01]
22:Can I change the delivery address for order #8821?	[0.02 0.99]
4 of 51 lines matched; 51 sent to Jev in 2 requests, 4275 input tokens, ~$0.000180
```

The bracket shows one probability per meaning, in the order given. Use it to pick a threshold.

With `--color` (on by default in a terminal) the probabilities are colored against the thresholds:
green at or above `-t`, red below `-T`, yellow in between. Line numbers and file names use grep's colors.

![colored output: line numbers in green, probabilities in green or red](docs/color.svg)

### AND NOT: network errors, excluding retries

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "network or remote connection failure" -v "a retry is happening or was attempted" tests/corpus.txt
4:2026-09-19 08:02:30 ERROR connection reset by peer while calling payment-gateway
6:2026-09-19 08:02:35 ERROR timeout after 5000ms waiting for payment-gateway
9:2026-09-19 08:10:44 ERROR DNS lookup failed for api.example.com
11:2026-09-19 09:00:00 ERROR SSL handshake failed: certificate expired
13:network unreachable: no route to host 10.0.0.5
30:except ConnectionError as e:
31:    logger.error("upstream unreachable: %s", e)
7 of 51 lines matched; 51 sent to Jev in 2 requests, 5112 input tokens
```

Line 5, `retrying payment-gateway request (attempt 2/3)`, is a network failure but is dropped by `-v`.

### Mixed: (finance AND negative) OR weather

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -e "about economy, finance or markets" -a "the news is negative or a decline" -e "about weather" tests/corpus.en.txt
36:Today's weather is sunny, high of 28 degrees
43:Stock prices fell 3% after the earnings report missed expectations.
48:Tomorrow's forecast is rain so I'll bring an umbrella
3 of 51 lines matched; 51 sent to Jev in 2 requests, 5499 input tokens, ~$0.000231
```

`The central bank raised interest rates` is about finance but not a decline, so it is out.

### Strictness presets

```sh
$ ./sys1grep --level strict -n -e "a security risk or dangerous destructive operation" tests/corpus.en.txt
33:DROP TABLE sessions;
49:API keys must never be committed to the repository.

$ ./sys1grep --level loose -n -e "a security risk or dangerous destructive operation" tests/corpus.en.txt
11:2026-09-19 09:00:00 ERROR SSL handshake failed: certificate expired
16:Inquiry from user Sato: I'm being charged for an order I never placed, it looks like fraud, please check urgently
33:DROP TABLE sessions;
49:API keys must never be committed to the repository.
```

`strict` keeps only what the model is sure about. `loose` also pulls in the expired certificate and the suspicious-billing ticket.

### Recursive search and file names only

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -r -n -e "customer is asking for a refund" tests/tickets/
tests/tickets/a.txt:7:Ticket #16: I want a refund, the item was broken.
tests/tickets/sub/b.txt:1:The customer wants a refund for the broken lamp.

$ ./sys1grep -rl -e "customer is asking for a refund" tests/tickets/
tests/tickets/a.txt
tests/tickets/sub/b.txt
```

`-r` walks directories in sorted order and skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `.ssh`, `.aws`, `.gnupg`, `.kube`,
`.docker`, binary files (a NUL byte in the first 8 KB, or a PDF; UTF-16 with a BOM is read as text), files
that usually hold secrets (`.env*`, `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.pgpass`, `.git-credentials`, `*.pem`,
`*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `id_rsa*` and friends; names compared without case) and
generated files (`*.map`, `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`,
`Cargo.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `composer.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `go.sum`). **Every line that is searched is sent
to the TypeSafe API**, so point `-r` at a directory
you mean to scan. Inside a git repository, `-r` also skips what git ignores (`.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, the
global excludes file), so build output and local files stay home; a tracked file is searched even if it matches.
A file named `*.gz` (a rotated log: `app.log.1.gz`) is read decompressed, as `zgrep` does, and printed by its
name on disk (`app.log.1.gz:12:...`); `--include='*.gz'` picks those, the binary sniff sees the decompressed
bytes, a gzipped secret (`private.key.gz`) is skipped like the plain one, and a corrupt `.gz` is an unreadable file.
Only gzip, only by the name.
A file named explicitly on the command line is always searched, even if it matches the skip list or is ignored;
so is a directory that git ignores, when you name it (`sys1grep -r -e ... dist`). `-l` prints each
matching file once, in the order matches are found, and works with or without `-r`. `-c` prints the number of
matching lines per file instead.

### Scope from the meaning

A meaning that restricts its matches to some kind of file can only match in such files. With `-r` and
`git sys1grep`, each meaning first asks Jev, in one small request, a yes / no per candidate, and a yes at 0.6 or
more narrows the files before anything else is sent. The rest is never read or sent. Each scope is reported on
stderr with Jev's answer, so a wrong one is visible:

```sh
$ sys1grep -r -e 'Python でリトライ処理を書いている箇所' .
sys1grep: scope: *.py *.pyi *.pyw (from "Python files: 0.94")
sys1grep: scope: 12 of 340 files
$ sys1grep -r -e '昨日変えた箇所で認証を扱っている' src/
sys1grep: scope: modified since 2026-09-25 00:00 (from "what was changed yesterday: 0.91")
sys1grep: scope: 3 of 120 files
```

- **Language or format**: 26 candidates (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP, C, C++,
  C#, Swift, Scala, R, shell script, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, YAML, JSON, TOML, XML, Dockerfile, Makefile), with
  GitHub Linguist's extensions and file names. Several yes answers are alternatives ("JavaScript か TypeScript").
- **Time of change**: 14 spans: the last minute, the last hour, today, yesterday, the last 1 / 2 / 3 / 7 / 30 days,
  this month, last week, last month, the last year, this fiscal year (from April 1). The narrowest span answered
  yes is taken, by its start only: a file changed yesterday may have been modified again today.
- **Place**: test code (`tests/ test/ __tests__/ spec/ e2e/`, `test_*.py *_test.* *.test.* *.spec.* *Test.java
  *_spec.rb`, and every `*.rs`: Rust keeps unit tests inside the file), database migrations (`*migrat*`, Flyway's
  `V1__*.sql`), the README, the changelog (`CHANGELOG* CHANGES* HISTORY* NEWS*`), documentation (`*.md *.rst *.adoc
  *.txt`, `docs/`), source code (whatever is not documentation, so languages missing from the dictionary still
  count) and logs (`*.log *.log.N *.out *.err`, `logs/`), by the path conventions of JS, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust
  and PHP. Several places are alternatives ("README か CHANGELOG に").
- **git**: in a repository, a time goes by commits: a committed file needs a commit at or after the start (the
  committer date; a checkout sets every mtime to now), an uncommitted one its mtime. States: uncommitted (worktree
  and index against HEAD, and untracked files), staged, untracked, this branch (since it left `origin/HEAD`, `main`
  or `master`), not pushed (`@{upstream}..HEAD`, else commits on no remote branch), and mine (`user.email`'s
  commits and the uncommitted files). Authors: the 30 with the most commits (`git shortlog`), each a candidate by
  name and e-mail; a yes narrows to every file a commit of theirs touched. Outside a repository none of these is
  asked, and a time goes by the mtime.
- Jev reads the whole meaning, in any language: "案A、B、Cで比較" is not about C files, and a date quoted in a
  comment is not when the file changed. Nothing is extracted from the text; the candidates are fixed.
- **Per term.** `-e A -e B` still searches B in the files A's scope leaves out; within an AND term, and across
  categories ("Python のテストコード"), the scopes intersect. Negated meanings (`-v`, `!`) are not asked. The
  meaning is sent unchanged.
- The question costs one small request per meaning, sent only when `-r` / `git sys1grep` found something to
  narrow, and after `-i`'s answer. `--dry-run` shows it as `[scope]`. As with `--include`, with `-r` a file named on
  the command line and stdin are never narrowed, and `git sys1grep`'s pathspecs are narrowed like the rest. `--no-auto-scope` turns it off (`--auto-scope` turns it back on).

### As a git subcommand (`git sys1grep`)

`npm install -g` also installs `git-sys1grep`, so git runs it as `git sys1grep`. Like `git grep`, it searches only
the files git tracks (ignored files and build output are never sent), and FILE arguments are pathspecs relative
to the current directory.

```sh
$ cd tests && git sys1grep -l -e "customer is asking for a refund" fixture.txt tickets
fixture.txt
tickets/a.txt
tickets/sub/b.txt
```

Without FILE it searches every tracked file under the current directory. The `-r` skip list (`.env*`, keys, ...)
applies even to tracked files. `--include`, `--exclude` and `--changed-within` filter the tracked files, those named
by a pathspec included. `--changed-within` reads the working tree's modification times, not git history: right after
a clone or a checkout, every file it wrote counts as just changed. For help use `git sys1grep -h`: git takes `--help` itself and looks for a man page.

`--cached`, `--untracked` and a `<tree>...` choose what is searched instead of the working tree, as `git grep` has
them (only one of the three at a time):

```sh
$ git sys1grep --cached -e "a retry is attempted"       # staged, uncommitted changes included
$ git sys1grep --untracked -e "a retry is attempted"    # tracked files plus untracked ones (.gitignore still applies)
$ git sys1grep -n -e "a retry is attempted" main v0.3.1 -- '*.py'
main:src/job.py:42:    retry(job, times=3)
v0.3.1:src/job.py:40:    retry(job)
```

A `<tree>` (a branch, tag, commit or `@{u}`) is any argument before `--` that resolves as a revision; several may
be given, searched in the order given, each line prefixed with the name as typed (`@{u}:path`, not the branch it
resolves to). `--changed-within` needs the working tree: a blob (`--cached`, a `<tree>`) has no mtime of its own.
A `<tree>`'s own pathspec takes a glob too, same as elsewhere in sys1grep (`git diff-tree` against the empty
tree, not `git ls-tree`'s own literal/directory-prefix match); `--include` / `--exclude` (by name) still work.
**An old `<tree>` can hold a secret an ordinary file once carried and was later removed from**: the skip list
drops files by name only, not by what changed since.

### Everything that is *not* something

```sh
./sys1grep -v "a timestamped server log line" mixed.txt   # like grep -v
./sys1grep -e "source code or SQL" -v "SQL" src.txt       # code, but not SQL
cat app.log | ./sys1grep -e "the deploy failed or was rolled back"
```

### Records that span several lines (`-z`)

The unit of judgement is a line. That is right for logs and source, and wrong when one record spans
several lines. `-z` makes the unit a NUL-terminated record instead, exactly as in `grep -z`, so it pairs
with the tools that already emit records: `git log -z`, `find -print0`, `xargs -0`.

A proposition like "this commit changes user-visible behaviour" is true of a whole commit, not of any one
line in it:

```sh
$ git log -z --format='%h %s %b' | ./sys1grep -z -n -e "the change alters user-visible behaviour" -v "documentation only"
7:21120e9 Revert "feat: ship the /sys1grep Claude Code skill" ...
8:51ae333 feat: ship the /sys1grep Claude Code skill
```

Matching records are printed NUL-terminated too, so pipe them through `tr '\0' '\n'` to read them.
File names (`-l`) and counts (`-c`) stay on newlines, as they do in grep. With `-z`, `-n` numbers records,
`-A` / `-B` / `-C` count neighbouring records, and `--chunk` counts records per request.

### One sentence at a time (`--unit=sentence-by-*`)

`--unit=sentence-by-jev` (or `sentence-by-rule`, below) judges each sentence instead of each line. The output is still lines, as in grep: every line a
matching sentence touches is printed, and on a terminal the sentence itself is in bold yellow (a regex match inside it, in grep's bold red).
Wrapped lines are joined before splitting, so a sentence that runs over several lines is judged as one.
[`tests/prose.txt`](tests/prose.txt) wraps an English paragraph and a Japanese one:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n --unit=sentence-by-jev -e "the author admits they made a mistake" tests/prose.txt
1:I should have checked the input
2:before shipping, and that was my
3:mistake. Next time I will add a test
```

The sentence starts on line 1 and ends at `mistake.` on line 3; only that part is colored, not
`Next time I will add a test`, which is judged separately and does not match.

On a terminal, with both meanings and `-C 3` for context, the colors show where each sentence starts and ends
inside a line: lines 3 and 9 are colored only up to the end of the matching sentence, and lines 4-7 are context (`-`):

![--unit=sentence-by-jev -C 3 --color: the matching sentences in bold yellow, up to mistake. on line 3 and 返金してほしいです。 on line 9; lines 4 to 7 as context](docs/sentence.svg)

`-o` prints only the matching sentences, one per line, as `grep -o` prints only the matching part.
`-n` then gives the line where the sentence starts. Japanese is joined without a space, as are Chinese,
Thai, Lao, Khmer, Myanmar and Tibetan, which do not put spaces between words:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n -o --unit=sentence-by-jev -e "the author admits they made a mistake" -e "customer is asking for a refund" tests/prose.txt
1:I should have checked the input before shipping, and that was my mistake.
8:先週買った掃除機が初日から動かないので返金してほしいです。
```

Without `-o`, `-c` counts lines and `-A` / `-B` / `-C` count lines, as usual. With `-o` they count sentences.
With `-z`, each record is split on its own and matching records are printed whole.

Jev finds a matching sentence inside a long line on its own, so `--unit=sentence-by-jev` is not needed for accuracy.
Use it to see which sentence matched, to get the sentences with `-o`, and when AND should hold within one
sentence: the expression is evaluated per sentence. For the same reason `-v X` alone prints every line
with at least one sentence that is not X; to find lines that are not X as a whole, leave `--unit` at `line`.

Japanese and Chinese entries often end without `。`: a chat message, a support ticket, a memo line. Joining
them would glue separate entries into one "sentence". So with
`--unit=sentence-by-jev` sys1grep asks Jev about each unpunctuated break next to a script written without word
spaces: "does this line break end a sentence or entry, or is it a wrap inside a sentence?" It sends 30 lines
per request with one yes/no per break, and keeps the lines apart when the answer is 0.7 or more. On
[`tests/corpus.txt`](tests/corpus.txt) this keeps the four one-line Japanese tickets apart, so
`--unit=sentence-by-jev` finds the same refund requests (lines 14 and 18) as a line-by-line search, where the rules alone
merged the tickets and missed line 18. The extra requests cost about as much as one more meaning; use
`--unit=sentence-by-rule` to skip them. Breaks between English lines are never asked: joining them keeps a space,
and the full stop still ends the sentence.

Where a newline cannot be inside a sentence, lines are not joined: at a blank line, next to brackets or
`;` (JSON, code), and before a line starting with `-` `*` `+` `#` `>` `"` or a digit (list items,
headings, quotes, numbers, timestamps). So JSONL keeps one line per record and each line is split on its
own. Sentences are cut by `Intl.Segmenter` ([Unicode UAX #29](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/)),
which splits at `.` `!` `?` `。` `！` `？` but also after abbreviations such as `Mr.`. Logs are not prose:
consecutive log lines that start with a letter, such as `WARN ...` after `ERROR ...`, get joined.

### One function at a time (`--unit=function`)

In code the question is usually about a function ("retries on network failure"), and one line of it rarely
says so. `--unit=function` judges each function and prints its lines, with `-n` giving file line numbers:

```sh
$ ./sys1grep -n --unit=function -e "retries on network failure" src/net.js
src/net.js:3:async function fetchWithRetry(url) {
src/net.js:4:  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
src/net.js:5:    try { return await fetch(url); }
src/net.js:6:    catch { await sleep(2 ** i * 100); }
src/net.js:7:  }
src/net.js:8:}
```

A function runs from a funcname line to the line before the next one, as `git grep -W` finds it; lines
before the first funcname line are one unit, and blank lines at a function's end are not printed. The
funcname lines are git's: the `diff=<driver>` attribute in `.gitattributes`, then `diff.<driver>.xfuncname`
in git config. Without one, sys1grep has its own rule for JavaScript/TypeScript (a top-level `function`,
`class`, or `const` / `let` / `var` bound to a function) and Python (`def` / `class`, nested ones too); a decorator line (`@retry`) starts
the function it decorates. Otherwise it uses git's default: a line starting with a letter, `_` or `$`. git's own builtin drivers
(`diff=python` and so on) are not read, so a driver without an `xfuncname` falls back the same way:

```sh
$ printf '*.go diff=golang\n' >> .gitattributes
$ git config diff.golang.xfuncname '^(func|type)[[:space:]]'
```

`-M` defaults to 8000 characters here, as with `-z`; a longer function is judged on its first 8000.
`--chunk` counts functions, `-A`/`-B`/`-C` and `-c` count lines, as with the sentence units. `-z`, `-g` and
`-o` are refused.

### From one function to another (`--step-to`)

A question about code often comes in two steps: where does `--summarize` hand the lines to the tool, and then,
what happens when that fails. The "that" in the second step is what the first one found. Multi-step matching
answers both in one run: the expression before `--step-to` finds the start, sys1grep walks the calls from it,
and the expression after `--step-to` picks the functions it reaches that match. Jev judges the two
expressions; no score decides which call to follow.

```sh
$ sys1grep -e "--summarize hands the lines to the tool" --step-to "what happens when the tool fails to start or answer" sys1grep.mjs
```

A meaning may start with a dash, as the first one does, on any search and for `-e`, `-a`, `-v` and `-Q`: a value that starts with `-` is taken as the meaning unless it is an option (an option holds no space).

Each path prints as a tree: the hop (the number of calls from the start), `file:line` and the function's name,
`:` after an end and `-` after a function on the way, as grep marks a match and its context. A regex-only
start and end send nothing, which makes a free reachability search. In Python 3.6's `json`, the functions
that `load` reaches and that hold a `raise`:

```
$ cd /usr/lib64/python3.6/json && sys1grep -e '/^\s*def load\b/' --step-to '/\braise\b/' *.py
sys1grep: walk: 1 at hop 0, 1 at hop 1, 3 at hop 2, 1 at hop 3, 1 at hop 4, 1 at hop 5; stopped: no new unit
0 __init__.py-274-load
  1 __init__.py:302:loads
    2 decoder.py:334:decode
      3 decoder.py:345:raw_decode
        4 scanner.py-65-scan_once
          5 scanner.py:28:_scan_once
```

- **The expressions.** The expression before `--step-to` is the start's, as in any search; every `-e` / `-a` /
  `-v` / `-Q` after it is the end's. `--step-to MEANING` and `--step-to '/RE/'` are `--step-to -e ...`; the file
  names follow. A step is a search, not a hop: one `--step-to` is two steps, whatever the hops between them.
- **The edges.** Without `--edges` the unit is a function (`--unit=function`) and an edge is a call: `name(` in
  a function's body, its comments, docstrings and strings left out, links to every function of that name. A name
  comes from the funcname line (the `def` under a decorator). `--edges=FILE` walks any other relation instead,
  one edge per line, `FROM_FILE:LINE<TAB>FROM_NAME<TAB>TO_FILE:LINE<TAB>TO_NAME`; a line stands for the unit that
  holds it. `--reverse` walks the edges backwards, callee to caller.
- **The walk.** Breadth first from every start at once. A function's hop is its shortest distance from any
  start, and each function is reached once, so a cycle ends. `--hops=N`, `--hops=M..N` and `--hops=M..` pick the
  hops an end may be at (default `0..`: a start that matches the end expression is an end at hop 0). A path that
  reaches no end is left out. stderr says how many functions each hop reached and why the walk stopped: no new
  function, or `--hops`.
- **The cost.** Jev judges every function against the start expression in one batch, then the functions reached
  within `--hops` against the end expression in another. `--max-cost` asks again before the second, counting the
  first. `--dry-run` answers every question 0, so it walks from every function the start expression could hold
  for and shows that bound.
- **Not with** `-z`, `-g`, `-o`, `-c`, `-l`, `-A`/`-B`/`-C`, `--rank`, `--summarize` or `--dedup`. `-p` adds the
  end expression's scores to each function judged against it; `-q` prints nothing and exits 0 when there is an end.

### One line per template (`--dedup`)

Cost is proportional to the text sent, and machine-generated logs are mostly one skeleton with a different
id or number in it. `--dedup` masks ids, hashes, numbers, dates and times, paths and URLs, groups lines by
the result, sends one line per group and reuses its answer for the rest. What is sent is that line's
original text, and every line is printed as itself:

`--dedup` takes `auto`, `always` or `never`; a bare `--dedup` is `--dedup=always`. **Default is `never`, for
now** (#143): `auto` is held back until real-run stats say it should be the default. Every run still
estimates locally, before anything is sent, what folding every kind (the best case) would save, and prints
one stderr hint when that is worth at least twice the cost of `--dedup`'s own question:

```
$ sys1grep -e "a request failed" app.log
sys1grep: 2040 units fold to at most 31 templates; --dedup=auto would save ~68 requests (~44k tokens)
```

`--dedup=auto` asks and folds only when that estimate says it pays; a file that barely repeats sends every
line, asking nothing extra. `--verbose` / `--dry-run` print the decision and its numbers for every value.

```sh
$ ./sys1grep --dedup -n -e "a request failed" app.log
1:worker request 3fa9c1e27b failed: connection reset
2:worker request 88d0e41a5c failed: connection reset
4:worker request 0b7f2a9e13 failed: connection reset
3 of 6 lines matched; 4 sent to Jev (2 folded by --dedup, ~235 input tokens / ~$0.000010 saved, 21%) in 2 requests, 907 input tokens, ~$0.000038
```

Whether a value may be folded depends on the meaning: a number decides "disk usage is above 90%", a time
decides "happened at night". So Jev is first asked, one small request per meaning, which kinds of value
could change a match, and those kinds are kept apart (one of the two requests above). With
`-e "disk usage is above 90%"` the same file keeps `95%` and `12%` apart and prints only `5:disk usage 95%`.

Measured on real logs, with nothing kept: a 43,071-line system log folds into 550 templates (1.2% of the
bytes), `install.log` to 21.1%, a Claude Code transcript (jsonl) only to 56.8%. It is for machine-generated
logs; prose has no shared skeleton, and a meaning that reads a timestamp folds almost nothing. With `-z` or
`--unit=sentence-by-*` the records or sentences fold instead of lines.

After a search, the summary line says what the folding saved: `(2 folded by --dedup, ~235 input tokens /
~$0.000010 saved, 21%)` above. It estimates what the folded lines would have cost as requests of their own and subtracts
what the value questions cost. On a small file or on prose, the result can be negative.

To see how far your own logs fold before paying for a search, `node scripts/dedup-measure.mjs FILE...`
counts lines, templates and the share of bytes sent, offline, with the same masks; `--keep=num,time` shows
a meaning that keeps those kinds apart.

The request's other lines are each line's context (#9), and `--dedup` changes them, so a line near the
threshold can be judged differently than in a full pass.

### A summary instead of the lines (`--summarize`)

When many lines match, what you want is often the gist: what they say about the meaning you searched for.
`--summarize` pipes what sys1grep would print to `claude -p --model haiku` (no tools, no settings, no CLAUDE.md),
asks it to summarize the lines as they bear on the meanings, and prints its answer instead of the lines.

```sh
$ sys1grep -r -n --summarize -e "the API key is read from a file" .
The key is read in sys1grep.mjs:22 from ~/.config/sys1grep/.env, never from ./.env (sys1grep.mjs:18), ...
```

The expensive model reads only what Jev kept. Asking why `./.env` is no longer read of this repository's
`git log` (168 commits), Claude's input fell from 22,059 tokens to 1,356, the total cost with Jev's from
$0.094 to $0.013, with the same answer (#69). It pays when the answer sits in a few lines.

- The matching lines leave the machine a second time, to Anthropic (or whatever TOOL talks to).
- `-n`, `-A/-B/-C`, `-p` and file names go in as they would print; colors never do. No match runs nothing (exit 1).
- `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER` picks the TOOL of a bare `--summarize`, `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` its model.
- `-q`, `-l` and `-c` print no lines, so they cannot be combined with it.
- In `SYS1GREP_OPTS` it summarizes every search, so every match goes to TOOL's provider too;
  `--no-summarize` turns it off for one search.
- The answer is plain text: an LLM that is not told writes Markdown, noise on a terminal, so plain is asked for.
  `--format=markdown` or `=html` asks for those instead (`… --format=html … > summary.html`).
  The answer prints as it comes, unchecked. In `SYS1GREP_OPTS` it is a standing preference, ignored without `--summarize` or `--rank`.
- With `--dedup`, the TOOL gets what Jev got: each template's representative once, marked `(×N like it)`,
  not every line its answer was reused for.
- More than 200 KB (about 50k tokens) is not sent at all: exit 2, with the size, before the TOOL is paid.
  It is never cut short, since a summary of the first part would read as a summary of all of it.

`--summarize-prompt=TEXT` adds your own instruction after the fixed one (how long, what to focus on):

```sh
$ sys1grep -r -n --summarize --summarize-prompt="3 lines or fewer, just which file to fix" \
    -e "the API key is read from a file" .
```

It needs `--summarize`; empty TEXT is the same as leaving it out. It comes after the `--format` sentence,
so TEXT can override the format.

Other TOOLs:

```sh
$ sys1grep --summarize=llm -e "..." FILE            # Simon Willison's llm, tools off (no -T given)
$ sys1grep --summarize=pi -e "..." FILE             # pi --print --no-tools --no-session ...
$ SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL=qwen3.5:9b sys1grep --summarize=ollama -e "..." FILE
$ SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL=some-id sys1grep --summarize=lmstudio -e "..." FILE   # model id from GET /v1/models
$ SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL=some-id sys1grep --summarize=http://localhost:8080/v1 -e "..." FILE  # llama.cpp, vLLM, LocalAI, a gateway
```

`ollama` and `lmstudio` talk to a local OpenAI-compatible server (`POST /v1/chat/completions`) by `fetch`, no
CLI: the matching lines never leave the machine a second time. A plain `http(s)://` URL is any other
OpenAI-compatible server. All three need `SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_MODEL`: none has a default model.
`SYS1GREP_SUMMARIZER_API_KEY` goes as `Authorization: Bearer` to a URL TOOL only (never `SYS1GREP_API_KEY`,
which is Jev's). `OLLAMA_HOST` moves ollama's host, as it does for the `ollama` CLI itself.

### A search page (`--serve`)

`--rank --format=html` answers one question per run. `--serve` opens the same page with a search box, so you can rephrase
and narrow without rerunning the command:

```
$ sys1grep --serve -r src/
http://127.0.0.1:51234/
$ sys1grep --serve=8080 -y --level=strict -r src/     # a fixed port; the options given here are the page's first values
```

The page has the meaning fields (`+` adds one; each takes `-e`, `-a`, `-v`, `-Q` or `--step-to:`), `rank`, `summarize`, a
**Details** fold with the other options (`--level`, `-t`/`-T`, `-C`, `--auto-scope`, `-n`, `-p`, `--dedup`, `--unit`,
`--include`, `--exclude`, `--changed-within`, `-g`, and `--hops` / `--reverse` while a `--step-to:` field exists), and above
the results the **command line** for the controls as they are now, with a Copy button; pasted in a terminal it runs the
same search. An option at its launch value is left out of what the controls add. `rank` off shows the matches in file order
as text, on shows the ranked cards; `summarize` adds a right column (it runs the search once more, so it costs one more
request). Estimate cost is `--dry-run`. The first field is a question (`-Q`) by default. Under the fields are pills of suggested questions: click one to fill the field and search. `--suggest=Q:TEXT` / `--suggest=e:TEXT` (repeat it; a bare TEXT is a question) sets them, with `-Q` or `-e`; without it three generic ones show. Every control and area has a hover text saying what it is. While a search runs, Search and Estimate are disabled and **Stop** ends it (the child process is killed). The matches are colored as `--color=always` colors them (file names, line numbers, regex matches), the cards mark them with `<mark>`.

Each search runs sys1grep itself (the options given at launch, then the controls'), so everything the command line does
the page does, and only that. The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only, answers only to that host name, and the page never
sees the API key. The targets, `-j`, `--chunk`, `-M`, `--max-filesize`, `--max-cost`, `-y`, `--edges`, `--template`, the
API settings and `--summarize`'s TOOL are fixed at launch: the page can narrow what was given but not widen it. A search
over the cost guard fails on the page, as it does without a terminal; launch with `-y` to let it through.
The meanings come from the page, so `-e -a -v -Q --step-to` and `-l -c -q -o -z -i --format --color --dry-run` are refused at launch.

### Best first (`--rank`)

Matches print in file order, as grep prints them. With many, `--rank` prints the results best first, each under a
numbered header. A result is a match with its `-A/-B/-C` lines; matches whose context touches are one result.

```sh
$ sys1grep -n -C1 --rank -e "the refund was refused" tickets/
1. tickets/b.txt
tickets/b.txt-2-Order #1234, placed 2026-08-01.
tickets/b.txt:3:Your refund was declined: the order is older than 30 days.
tickets/b.txt-4-Please contact support.

2. tickets/a.txt
tickets/a.txt-11-Order #88 arrived.
tickets/a.txt:12:Refund request received.
tickets/a.txt-13-We will check it.
```

- `--rank` is `--rank=jev`: after the search, Jev is asked of each result, lines and context together, whether it
  is relevant to the meanings that are not negated. One more question per result, `--chunk` results (at most 64) to a request;
  `--dry-run` / `-i` show an upper bound, since which results there are is known only after the search.
- `--rank=match` sorts by each result's highest match probability, with no request. It is the answer to a yes/no
  question on one line, so clear matches sit close together, and the context is not read.
- `-p` puts the score on the header (`1. [0.96] tickets/b.txt`). `-l` lists the files by their best result.
- `--format=markdown` writes a `## 1. tickets/b.txt` heading and a fenced block per result; `--format=html` one
  self-contained HTML document from a template (below), light and dark, with a relevance bar per result. The lines
  are as they print, escaped; what matched is in `<mark>` (the regex matches, else the matching sentences, else the whole
  matching line; context lines are not marked; `--color=never` turns it off).
- `--summarize` gets the results in ranked order; with `--dedup` a representative is one result.
- It needs a meaning (a regex, `!` or `-v` alone ranks nothing), and cannot be combined with `-c`, `-o` or `-q`.
  `--no-rank` turns off an earlier one, from `SYS1GREP_OPTS` say.

### HTML templates (`--template`)

`--rank --format=html` and `--summarize --format=html` fill in a template. Four come with sys1grep: `default`, `print` (black on white, serif,
for paper and PDF), `search` (a results page like a web search engine's) and `terminal` (dark monospace).
`--template=NAME` picks one; `SYS1GREP_TEMPLATE`, in the
environment or `~/.config/sys1grep/.env`, sets the default.

```sh
$ sys1grep -r -n -C1 --rank -p --format=html --template=print -e "the refund was refused" tickets/ > refunds.html
```

A template is one HTML file. The part between `<!--result-->` and `<!--/result-->` is repeated for each result;
what is before and after it is written once. sys1grep replaces these, escaped, and leaves any other `{{…}}` as
written:

| placeholder | where | value |
|---|---|---|
| `{{title}}` | anywhere | `sys1grep: ` and the meanings |
| `{{query}}` | anywhere | the meanings, as in `"refund" and not "policy"` |
| `{{count}}` | anywhere | the number of results (with `--summarize`, of matching lines) |
| `{{answer}}` | anywhere | `--summarize`'s answer; empty with `--rank` |
| `{{rank}}` | per result | 1, 2, … |
| `{{score}}` | per result | the score as `-p` prints it (`0.96`); empty without `-p` |
| `{{score_pct}}` | per result | the score as a whole number 0 to 100, set even without `-p` (for a bar: `style="--s:{{score_pct}}"`) |
| `{{file}}` | per result | the file name; empty when one file is searched |
| `{{lines}}` | per result | the result's lines as they print |

`--template=NAME` reads `~/.config/sys1grep/templates/NAME.html` if it is there, else the bundled one, so your
copy of `default` replaces it. A value containing `/` or ending in `.html` is a file path. To make your own, copy
the bundled ones and edit:

```sh
$ sys1grep --install-templates            # "copied PATH" for each file
$ cp ~/.config/sys1grep/templates/default.html ~/.config/sys1grep/templates/team.html
$ sys1grep -r --rank --format=html --template=team -e "..." src/ > out.html
$ sys1grep --template=list                # one name a line, "(user)" after those under ~/.config
```

`{{score_pct}}` is set even without `-p`, so a bar can show the relevance without printing the number.

With `--summarize --format=html` the TOOL is asked for plain text, and that answer, escaped, goes into `{{answer}}`
once it has finished; the part between `<!--result-->` and `<!--/result-->` is not written. A template for
`--summarize` therefore needs `{{answer}}` outside that part (the bundled ones have it; with `--rank` it is empty).

```sh
$ sys1grep -r --summarize --format=html --template=print -e "why the refunds were refused" tickets/ > why.html
```

A template is trusted local input: a path you give, or a symlink in the templates directory, is read as it is;
only the results put into it are escaped.

`--install-templates` never overwrites a file that is already there (it prints `kept` for it). A missing
template, or one without exactly one `<!--result-->` before one `<!--/result-->`, is exit 2 naming the file.
`--template` on the command line needs `--format=html` with `--rank` or `--summarize` (not `-l`); `SYS1GREP_TEMPLATE` is simply unused elsewhere.
`--template=list` and `--install-templates` take no other arguments and are refused in `SYS1GREP_OPTS`.

## Use it from Claude Code

There is a Claude Code skill that runs sys1grep for you: describe what you are looking for in plain words
and it builds the expression, runs the search and reports `file:line` hits. It is published in the
[`uehaj/uehaj-marketplace`](https://github.com/uehaj/uehaj-marketplace) marketplace as the `uehaj` plugin.

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add uehaj/uehaj-marketplace
claude plugin install uehaj@uehaj-marketplace
```

No separate install of the command-line tool is needed: the skill uses `sys1grep` from your PATH if present,
otherwise `npx @uehaj/sys1grep`. Only the API key has to be set (see [Install](#install)).

Then, inside Claude Code:

```
/uehaj:sys1grep customer is asking for a refund tickets/*.txt
/uehaj:sys1grep a fix that shipped without a test git log --oneline -200
```

Claude Code installs plugins, not single skills. If you want just this one skill, the
[skills CLI](https://skills.sh/) copies it into `~/.claude/skills/` and it is invoked as `/sys1grep`:

```sh
npx skills add uehaj/uehaj-marketplace --skill sys1grep -a claude-code -g
```

The skill writes the meaning in English, picks `-e` / `-a` / `-v` for AND / OR / NOT, adds `-n`, narrows large
directories to files worth paying for, and re-runs with `--level loose` or `strict` when the first result looks off.
The API key and endpoint are read the same way as on the command line (`SYS1GREP_API_KEY`, `~/.config/sys1grep/.env`).

## Usage

```
usage: sys1grep [OPTION]... -e MEANING|-Q QUESTION [-a MEANING] [-v MEANING]... [FILE...]

  -e MEANING   lines matching this meaning (several -e are OR'd)
  -Q, --question QUESTION  lines that answer QUESTION, not lines asking it; the same as
               -e "the line answers: QUESTION" (see "Lines that answer a question" above)
  -a MEANING   AND onto the preceding -e/-Q term.      -e A -a B -e C  =  (A and B) or C
  -v MEANING   AND NOT onto the preceding -e/-Q term.  -e A -v B       =  A and not B
               At the front it is a bare negation.  -v B            =  not B  (like grep -v)
  !MEANING     a leading ! negates just that meaning, in -e / -Q / -a / -v alike
               -e A -e '!B'  =  A or not B.   -a '!C' is the same as -v C
  --level=LEVEL strictness preset, sets both thresholds (default normal)
                 loose  : -t 0.3 -T 0.7  catch more, accept some noise
                 normal : -t 0.5 -T 0.5
                 strict : -t 0.7 -T 0.3  only confident matches
  -t THRESH    positive threshold: match when probability >= THRESH (overrides --level)
  -T THRESH    negative threshold: "not X" when probability < THRESH (overrides --level)
               with -t 0.6 -T 0.3 a line at 0.3..0.6 matches neither X nor not-X
  -r           recurse into directories (current directory when FILE is omitted);
               skips .git, node_modules, binary files, likely secrets, generated files and what git ignores
  --cached     git sys1grep only: search the index instead of the working tree, as git grep --cached
  --untracked  git sys1grep only: also search untracked files (.gitignore still applies), as git grep --untracked
  <tree>...    git sys1grep only: a branch, tag, commit or @{u} before -- searches that revision's tree
               instead, as git grep does; output is prefixed <tree>: with the name as typed
  --include=GLOB, --exclude=GLOB  with -r and git sys1grep, only files whose name matches GLOB, or not
               (with -r a file named on the command line is always searched; git sys1grep's pathspecs are filtered)
  --changed-within=WHEN  with -r and git sys1grep, only files modified within 30m / 2h / 7d / 2w, since a date
               or date-time, today, this-week or this-month
  --no-auto-scope  do not narrow those files by what a meaning says about them (see Scope from the meaning);
               --auto-scope turns it back on
  -l           print only the names of files with a match, not the lines
  -H, --with-filename  prefix file names even for a single file; --no-filename never prefixes them
  -A NUM       print NUM lines of trailing context after each match (context lines use - as separator)
  -B NUM       print NUM lines of leading context before each match
  -C NUM       print NUM lines of context before and after (-A NUM -B NUM)
  -c           print only a count of matching lines per file (like grep -c)
  -q, --quiet  print nothing, stop at the first match; exit 0 on a match, even after an error (like grep -q)
  --chunk=LINES lines per request (default 30; a request also carries at most 64 questions, so fewer lines
               with 3 or more meanings)
               Lines in one request are each other's context, so a small chunk changes verdicts
               on ambiguous lines, not just speed
  -j N         concurrent requests (default 8)
  -n           print line numbers
  --unit=UNIT  the unit of judgement: line (default), zero, sentence-by-jev, sentence-by-rule or function
  -z, --null-data  --unit=zero: judge NUL-terminated records instead of lines, and print them NUL-terminated (see "Records that span several lines" above);
               with --unit=sentence-by-*, each record is split into sentences
  --unit=sentence-by-jev|sentence-by-rule  judge each sentence instead of each line (see "One sentence at a time" above)
  --unit=function  judge each function and print its lines (see "One function at a time" above)
  --step-to EXPRESSION  print the paths from the functions the expression before it matches, along the
               calls, to the functions the expression after it matches (see "From one function to another" above)
  --edges=FILE walk the edges in FILE instead of the calls; --reverse walks them backwards
  --hops=N|M..N|M..  the hops an end may be at (default 0..)
  -o           with --unit=sentence-by-*, print only the matching sentences
  -p           print each meaning's probability at the end of the line
  --dry-run    send nothing; print the settings the search would run with (and their source, when not the
               command line), each file searched and each request with its questions
  --verbose    print the same to stderr while searching
  -i, --interactive  show what --dry-run would send, and search only after y on the terminal
  -M NUM, --max-columns=NUM  send at most the first NUM characters of a line (or record, with -z); still
               searched and judged, just not past that cutoff (default 2000, 8000 with -z)
  --max-filesize=SIZE  size every target first (K/M/G, default 10M); over it, skip it outright, like rg's own
               --max-filesize (-y does not affect it). stdin is sized once read, and skipped the same way if
               it is over; a --cached / <tree>: target is a blob, sized from its content; -g's commits stay
               out of this (each is already bounded by -M when sent)
  --max-cost=USD  price the input about to be sent; over it (default 1), ask to continue on the terminal; -y
               answers yes without asking; no terminal and the limit exceeded is exit 2, unchanged by -q
               (scripts pass -y); -i already asks unconditionally and earlier, so this does not ask again
  --dedup[=auto|always|never]  judge one line per template and reuse its answer for the rest (default never,
               for now; see "One line per template" above)
  --rank[=jev|match]  print the results (a match with its context) best first, under numbered headers; jev
               (bare --rank) asks Jev of each result, match sorts by its best match probability (see "Best first"); --no-rank: file order
  --serve[=PORT]  serve a search page on 127.0.0.1 instead of searching (see "A search page (`--serve`)")
  --template=NAME  the document --rank or --summarize --format=html writes: ~/.config/sys1grep/templates/NAME.html, else the
               bundled one (default, print, terminal), or a file; default SYS1GREP_TEMPLATE, else default.
               --template=list prints the names (see "HTML templates")
  --install-templates  copy the bundled templates to ~/.config/sys1grep/templates, keeping existing files
  --color[=WHEN] auto (default: color when stdout is a terminal) / always / never; bare --color means auto
               file and line number use grep's colors; with -p, probabilities are
               green at or above the positive threshold, red below the negative one,
               yellow in between. NO_COLOR is honored
  --sys1-model=ID, --sys1-url=URL, --sys1-api-key=KEY
               the API settings, overriding SYS1GREP_MODEL, SYS1GREP_URL, SYS1GREP_API_KEY
  -h, --help   this help (Japanese when LANG / LC_ALL / LC_MESSAGES starts with ja)
  -V, --version  print the version and exit
```

Without FILE, stdin is read. With several files, output is prefixed with `file:`.
Exit codes follow grep: 0 matched, 1 no match, 2 error (bad arguments, unreadable file, API failure).
Exit 1 after lines were sent prints one line on stderr: the highest probability, its line, the option that
loosens the threshold (unless even that would not match), and `-p -t 0` (`-T 1` too with a negation) to see every
probability (`sys1grep: no line reached 0.5 for "…"; the highest was 0.42 (app.log:118). ...`).
Not with `-q`, `--summarize` or `--step-to`, nor when only a negated meaning kept lines out.

### Expression grammar

`-e` starts an OR term. `-a` and `-v` extend the previous term with AND and AND NOT.
A leading `!` on a meaning negates just that meaning (quote it, `!` is history expansion in most shells).

| command | means |
|---|---|
| `-e A -e B` | A or B |
| `-e A -a B` | A and B |
| `-e A -v B` | A and not B |
| `-e A -a B -v C -e D` | (A and B and not C) or D |
| `-e A -e '!B'` | A or not B |
| `-v B` | not B |

## How it works

1. Non-blank lines are cut into chunks of 30 lines (with a character cap, and at most 64 questions a request).
2. Each chunk goes into `state` as an object `{"L000": "line 1", "L001": "line 2", ...}`,
   and one `noul` (yes/no probability) question per line × meaning goes into the same request.
3. Up to 8 requests run concurrently. Output is printed in file order.
4. Per line, each meaning's probability is thresholded to a boolean and the AND / OR / NOT expression is evaluated.

Lines sent together are each other's context: Jev judges a line against what the rest of the chunk shows
is normal in the file. Clear matches and non-matches hold, but ambiguous lines can move. Where the chunk
boundaries fall barely matters (moving them by 15 lines at `--chunk 30` flipped 1 line in 200 of a log), but
judging a line with little of its file around it does: `--chunk 1` flipped 18 of the same 200, and those
solitary verdicts were the less reliable ones (#9). So `--chunk` changes results, not just speed, and a
very short input is judged with little context whatever `--chunk` says. One line at a time is also slow
(30 lines in one request take about 0.2 s, one line at a time about 7 s).
Very large chunks start losing lines near the threshold, hence the default of 30.
Probabilities drift by about ±0.05 between runs. Use `-p` when tuning thresholds.

Pricing is $0.042 per million input tokens (September 2026). A 30-line chunk with two meanings is about
3,000 tokens. Throughput is bounded by the rate limit of 1,200 requests per minute, roughly 36,000 lines
per minute at the defaults.

## Tests

`tests/` holds an LLM-as-judge test. Each of the 10 cases in `tests/cases.json` runs against
`tests/corpus.txt` (51 lines). Claude (`claude -p`) decides which lines truly match each meaning;
the runner evaluates the boolean expression on those verdicts and compares with sys1grep's output,
reporting precision and recall. It also sweeps `-t` × `-T` in 0.05 steps and reports the best pair.

```sh
node --no-warnings tests/judge.mts [--model sonnet] [--rejudge]
```

Judge verdicts are cached in `tests/verdicts.json`; later runs do not call the judge.
The result is written to `tests/report.md`. Latest: precision 0.94, recall 0.98.

## Limits

- Every searched line is sent to api.typesafe.ai. Do not run it over files you would not upload there.
- Blank lines are not sent; they count as probability 0 for every meaning, so `-v X` prints them and `-e X` never does.
- Lines are truncated to 2,000 characters before sending.
- The maximum number of questions per request is undocumented; 420 worked. sys1grep itself sends at most 64 a request (Clef's cap); only a single unit asked more than 64 meanings goes out whole.
- 429 / 529 are retried up to 6 times with exponential backoff.
- Accuracy is best in English. Japanese works but is noisier.

## FAQ

Some options were left out because a standard tool in front of sys1grep already does the job. These are the
combinations.

### How do I judge a whole paragraph as one unit? Why is there no `--paragraph`?

Join each paragraph into one line first. `fmt` joins the lines of a paragraph and keeps the blank lines
between paragraphs:

```sh
fmt -w 100000 essay.txt | sys1grep -n -e "the author admits they made a mistake"
```

Each output line is then a whole paragraph, and `-n` counts the lines of `fmt`'s output, not of the file.
`fmt` puts a space where it joins two Japanese lines; Jev reads through it. To judge sentences across
wrapped lines you need neither: `--unit=sentence-by-jev` already joins them.

### How do I search a JSONL chat log one message at a time?

Take the text out with `jq` and end each message with NUL, then judge records with `-z`:

```sh
jq -j '.content + "\u0000"' chat.jsonl | sys1grep -z -n --unit=sentence-by-jev -e "the customer is asking for a refund" | tr '\0' '\n'
```

Adjust `.content` to where your log keeps the text. Each message becomes one record, so a sentence never
runs into the next speaker's message, and the JSON punctuation is not sent. `-n` numbers messages. The file
also works as is, one JSON object per line; `jq` just gives cleaner units.

### My records are separated by something other than NUL. Why is there no `--record-separator`?

Turn the separator into NUL and use `-z`. For records separated by a `----` line:

```sh
perl -0777 -pe 's/\n----\n/\0/g' notes.txt | sys1grep -z -e "a decision was made" | tr '\0' '\n'
awk '/^----$/ { printf "%c", 0; next } { print }' notes.txt | sys1grep -z -e "a decision was made" | tr '\0' '\n'
```

NUL is what `git log -z`, `find -print0` and `xargs -0` already emit, so `-z` covers them directly (#6).
A general separator would bring escaping, multi-byte and regex-or-literal questions for a case one line of
`perl` or `awk` handles. The `awk` form works with the BSD awk on macOS, which does not take a
multi-character `RS`.
